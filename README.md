# Mock MQTT Client Test

This is a small test how a mock MQTT client could be realized. To run it, first start the MQTT broker on the localhost, then start mqtt-test.py and mock_bernd_box_client.py with

    python mock_bernd_box_client.py
    python mqtt-test.py

Quit and restart the mqtt-test.py for action. One example MQTT broker is the Node.js _Mosca_ program.
